<h1>GMTK Game Jam 2025 Devlog</h1>

<section>
    <p>
        After a few unsuccessful attempts at past game jams, I decided to take a more relaxed approach this time.
        I spent a day researching and watching some videos to get inspired.
        One of the ideas came from this video:

    <h2>Day One</h2>
    <p>
        The theme for this year's jam was <strong>"LOOP"</strong>. It didn‚Äôt take long to come up with a concept that felt doable.
        The core idea: the player has to complete a game jam while facing constant distractions that lower their sanity.
        The goal is to finish within the 3-day jam limit.
    </p>

    <p>Here's a screenshot from Day 1:</p>

    <p>
        So far, the in-game time system works, the sanity bar is functional, and game progress is tracked.
        I also added light occlusion (not sure why, honestly üòÖ).
        Hopefully, it'll be ready for playtesting by tomorrow!

        Quick rundown of today‚Äôs progress before I crash:
