<p>There’s always been something special about having a personal website — a quiet little corner of the internet to call home. Over time, that curiosity grew into tinkering with home servers and self-hosting, just for the fun of it. But somewhere along the way, it was easy to get swept up in the wave of shiny new frameworks. One moment it’s simple HTML,  the next you’re lost in the jungle, wondering when your 'simple blog' started needing a build pipeline and a PhD in Webpack.</p>

<p>At some point, it just made sense to pause and simplify. Everyone has their own taste, their own rhythm — and this setup just feels right. Clean, low-maintenance, and easy to build on when the mood strikes.</p>

<p>It’s a quiet little plot in the vast digital landscape — a stable orbit in a galaxy full of wild experiments and blinking UIs. Not the flashiest orbit in the galaxy, but it’s comfy, and hey — it’s home.</p>
