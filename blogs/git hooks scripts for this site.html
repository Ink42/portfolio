<p>There’s always been something special about having a personal website — a quiet little corner of the internet to call home. Over time, that curiosity grew into tinkering with home servers and self-hosting, just for the fun of it. But somewhere along the way, it was easy to get swept up in the wave of shiny new frameworks e.g my old <a href="https://portfolio-website-omega-self.vercel.app/">website</a>. One moment it’s simple HTML,  the next you’re lost in the jungle, wondering when your 'simple blog' started needing a build pipeline and a PhD in Webpack.</p>

<p>At some point, it just made sense to pause and simplify. Everyone has their own taste, their own rhythm — and this setup just feels right. Clean, low-maintenance, and easy to build on when the mood strikes.</p>

<p>It’s a quiet little plot in the vast digital landscape — a stable orbit in a galaxy full of wild experiments and blinking UIs. Not the flashiest orbit in the galaxy, but it’s comfy, and hey — it’s home.</p>
